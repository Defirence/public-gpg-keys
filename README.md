# public-gpg-keys
My rotating set of public GPG/PGP keys used for signing commits, packages, releases etc.

✔️ Current Key Fingerprint: 

`C02D 33B6 5AC5 B2EE 6AE3 AC5F BCD6 1944 3BDA 19B4`

GitHub Key ID: ` BCD619443BDA19B4`

Generated: `18-04-2022`

❌ ~~`A6A4 1A3B DE6C 5667 4D35 9242`~~ 

GitHub Key ID: `AD6DC3BA2DF4E9A4`

N.B: Older, unverified commits using this ***specific*** GPG signature are still valid since I unintentionally broke the `uid` for the primary email (my personal email address) by revoking it from this previous keypair.

Notes:

Some Release packages might not be signed yet.

e.g: custom-steam-status, all current and past releases.
